# Round 1

### D0. 2/24/20

Set up new repo for my 100 Days of Code log.

This is my second attempt at the challenge - only reached until Day 13 on my first one. I still continued coding after that, but I stopped logging my progress and learnings so I'm a little overwhelmed as to what I already know and how to move forward. So I thought it would be simpler to start fresh.

Also, another reason was that commits I made to my old log (which is a fork of the [original template](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code)) were not being counted towards my contribution graph. [See GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#commit-was-made-in-a-fork) for more info.

For my next steps, I'll review my [old log](https://github.com/joshjavier/OLD-100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) to refresh my memory and get some ideas on where I want to go next.
