# Round 1

## 2. Sass basics
### Day 2: Thursday, April 2, 2020

I learned about Sass today! It's like CSS + Javascript, which means it can:
- set variables
- use templating syntax
- use conditional logic in styling

Having a bit of experience in Javascript and Python made the concepts easy to understand, although I'm starting to get confused whether to place a colon `:` or an equal sign `=`

Hopefully I can now understand other blogs' source codes when looking for inspiration for my own site üïµÔ∏è

Why use Sass? DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## 1. Semver, commit best practices
### Day 1: Wednesday, April 1, 2020

Read about [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), and [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/).

**Thoughts:** Becoming familiar with the concept of atomic commits has helped me become more organized even in projects that are not strictly using version control. One example is an Apps Script to automate some tasks at my day job (I should probably write about this in my blog).

I'm mostly working on small projects for now, so I may not follow these guidelines to a T. But I'll have to keep them in mind when I start working on bigger projects/teams.

### D0. 2/24/20

Set up new repo for my 100 Days of Code log.

This is my second attempt at the challenge - only reached until Day 13 on my first one. I still continued coding after that, but I stopped logging my progress and learnings so I'm a little overwhelmed as to what I already know and how to move forward. So I thought it would be simpler to start fresh.

Also, another reason was that commits I made to my old log (which is a fork of the [original template](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code)) were not being counted towards my contribution graph. [See GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#commit-was-made-in-a-fork) for more info.

For my next steps, I'll review my [old log](https://github.com/joshjavier/OLD-100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) to refresh my memory and get some ideas on where I want to go next.
