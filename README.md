# 100 Days of Code Log

This repo is for tracking my progress in the [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

Previously, I had been using a fork of the original template to track my progress&mdash;until I found that [commits in forked repos don't count towards the contribution graph](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#commit-was-made-in-a-fork).

So, I made my own repo and took a bit of inspiration from [James Priest](https://github.com/james-priest/100-days-log) to turn it into a GitHub Pages site (the one you're looking at!)

If you're interested on joining the challenge, check out the [#100DaysOfCode Official Website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to learn more.

You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshjavierr/) to get regular updates about my progress or say hi. :)
